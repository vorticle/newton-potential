boxpot is a library for analytically evaluating the Newton potential in
arbitrary precision arithmetic. The mathematical background and the usage
of the library is documented in the following article:

Matthias Kirchhard and Donat Weniger. "Analytic Integration of the Newton
Potential over Cuboids and an Application to Fast Multipole Methods",
Journal of Numerical Mathematics. DOI: 10.1515/jnma-2020-0103

boxpot is a header-only library. Simply copy the boxpot folder to a suitable
location, e.g., /usr/local/include on unix systems.

boxpot is released under the terms and conditions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, version 3, or, at your option, any later version.

The "examples" folder contains the examples described in the paper. In order
to compile them, you require the Boost.Multiprecision library and the GNU
Multiprecision library. In the example folder, when using GCC, simply run

g++ -I..      eval_example.cpp -o      eval_example -lgmp
g++ -I.. hackbusch_example.cpp -o hackbusch_example -lgmp
g++ -I..     table_example.cpp -o     table_example -lgmp

and change the -I directive to whatever directory contains the boxpot
folder.

The folder "general" contains the fast multipole method example described
in Section 5 of the article. It is *NOT* licensed under the LGPL, but the
(full) GPL. In order to compile this you will need the Armadillo C++ library
(http://arma.sourceforge.net) and an implementation of the BLAS. We used
OpenBLAS (http://www.openblas.net) for our experiments.
