The program "compute_interaction_matrices" is independent of the rest of
this software. It can be used to pre-compute the interaction matrices.
(Who would have thought?)

Compile using:

g++ -O3 -fopenmp -I. compute_interaction_matrices.cpp -o compute_interaction_matrices -lgmp

Note that this distribution already comes with a set of pre-computed
interaction matrices for orders n = 1, 2, 3, 4. It thus should not be
necessary to run this program. They can be found in the math folder.
